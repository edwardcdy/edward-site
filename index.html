        <div class="description"> 
          I a sophomore at Dartmouth College ('19), currently studying computer science and economics. My interests in computer 
          science involve machine learning and artificial intelligence, web design, and hacking and security. On the 
          economics side, most of my experience has been in the field of industrial organization. Someday, I hope to be able to
          design a compiler that parses actual english language into working code. <br><br>

          In my free time, I enjoy music-related activities. You will often catch me dancing with my hip-hop dance group, Street Soul.
          Another place that I can be found is the practice room, where I enjoy learning new piano pieces. If you're super lucky,
          you might just catch me sketching away in a sketchbook, although the chances of that happening are very slim (I would advise 
          anyone that does indeed see me attempting to scribble to immediately purchase lottery tickets).
